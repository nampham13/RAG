# Rule-Based Chunker Implementation

## Enhancements Made

The RuleBasedChunker has been enhanced with the following features:

1. **Improved Structural Pattern Detection**
   - Enhanced regex patterns for identifying document structure elements
   - Better detection of headings, lists, tables, and code blocks
   - More accurate identification of structural boundaries

2. **spaCy Integration**
   - Uses spaCy for linguistic analysis of heading structures
   - Integrates POS tagging for improved heading detection
   - Falls back to regex patterns when spaCy is unavailable

3. **Hierarchical Structure Recognition**
   - Detects heading levels and nesting relationships
   - Groups content based on heading hierarchy
   - Preserves document structure in the resulting chunks

4. **Adaptive Content Grouping**
   - Intelligently groups related content blocks together
   - Maintains continuity between related paragraphs
   - Preserves list items and bullet points within the same chunk

5. **Structure-Aware Chunk Generation**
   - Creates chunks that respect document structure
   - Avoids breaking across important structural boundaries
   - Maintains hierarchical relationships between chunks

## Usage

```python
from chunkers.rule_based_chunker import RuleBasedChunker

# Create a chunker with specified parameters
chunker = RuleBasedChunker(
    max_chunk_size=1000,           # Maximum chunk size (characters)
    min_chunk_size=200,            # Minimum chunk size (characters)
    use_spacy=True,                # Use spaCy for enhanced detection
    heading_patterns=None          # Custom heading patterns (optional)
)

# Process a document
chunks = chunker.chunk(document)
```

## Implementation Details

The RuleBasedChunker uses a two-step approach:

1. **Document Structure Analysis**
   - Identifies structural elements using regex and NLP
   - Maps the document's hierarchical organization
   - Creates a structural tree representation

2. **Structure-Based Chunking**
   - Groups content based on structural relationships
   - Applies size constraints while respecting boundaries
   - Creates chunks that maintain contextual integrity

This approach ensures chunks that preserve document structure and relationships, improving the quality of downstream processing in RAG systems.
