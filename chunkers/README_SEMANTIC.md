# Semantic Chunking Implementation Summary

## Overview

The semantic chunker has been implemented to divide text into semantically coherent chunks. It leverages spaCy for NLP tasks and focuses on lexical overlap and discourse markers for determining coherence.

## Key Features

1. **spaCy Integration**:
   - Sentence segmentation using spaCy's sentencizer
   - POS tagging for pronoun detection
   - Named entity recognition for topic coherence
   - Content word extraction with lemmatization

2. **Coherence Measurement**:
   - Lexical overlap between sentences
   - Pronoun references detection
   - Named entity continuity
   - Discourse markers identification

3. **Vietnamese Language Support**:
   - Fallback pattern for Vietnamese character sets
   - Special sentence splitting for Vietnamese diacritics

## Usage Example

```python
from chunkers.semantic_chunker import SemanticChunker

# Initialize chunker
chunker = SemanticChunker(
    max_tokens=512,
    overlap_tokens=50,
    min_sentences_per_chunk=3,
    spacy_model="en_core_web_sm"  # Use "vi_core_news_lg" for Vietnamese
)

# Process a document
chunk_set = chunker.chunk(document)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Text Processing Pipeline

1. Document text is extracted from blocks
2. Text is split into sentences using spaCy
3. Sentences are grouped based on coherence
4. Chunks are created from sentence groups

### Coherence Calculation

- Base score: 0.5
- Lexical overlap bonus: +0.3 (max)
- Pronoun reference bonus: +0.2
- Named entity overlap bonus: +0.15
- Discourse markers bonus: +0.15
- Paragraph break penalty: -0.2

## Optimization Notes

- Content word extraction prioritizes named entities and noun chunks
- Sentence segmentation handles list items and special formatting
- Token estimation uses tiktoken when available for accurate counts
